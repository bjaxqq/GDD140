# Project 11

## Instructions

Use what we learned about keyboard input (or using mouse input from earlier in the semester), detecting collisions, create a simple "game" where you control a sprite avoiding (or collecting) other sprites. Do the following:

- Begin with a "Player" sprite that you can control using the WASD or Arrow keys or both.
- The player must move to reach a goal.
- The player must go around obstacles or push the obstacles out of the way to get to the goal.
- The player must avoid enemies and reach the goal to be safe! (think Frogger).
- Use Groups.
- Consider either using wrapping blocks, or using a spawner for the enemies.
- If the player reaches the goal remove allsprites and display text "You Survived!"
- Use keyboard input to restart the game.
- Each time the game restarts, the goal will be in a different location.
- Try to make it somewhat challenging but not impossible.
- Consider having the enemies static or moving and consider varying the size, speed and frequency of each "enemy".
- Moving the enemies is optional.
- Consider adding a title screen with a prompt such as "Press the spacebar to start."
- Consider adding a "You Win" or "You Lose" Screen.
- Consider adding sound effects and a timer (both optional).
- Search and find your own sound samples or sound effects.
- In the beginning of your code, include a few comments about how to play your game.

## Solution

Since [Project 10](https://github.com/bjaxqq/GDD140/tree/master/Project%2010) already had pretty much all of the requirements for here, I decided to improve on that original game. In the new version, there is a level cap at 15 (or 120 coins collected), and there are some fun sounds that play when you collect a coin or hit an obstacle.
