# Project 5

## Instructions

Create a pattern for wallpaper using just multiple for loops. Please be creative and spend time perfecting it. The more individual repeating elements in your pattern the better. The more complex and intricate the pattern, the better. Choose a color palette from this site to work with. Feel free to add more colors than specified in your palette. Use Google to search images for examples of patterns. Your Wallpaper does not need to be animated!

## Solution

Disregarding that last statement, I was determined to create an image that would have some kind of animation. So, I came up with a black screen that displays pulsating orbs in a grid. These orbs shift through different colors and move in a wave pattern which creates a really cool effect.
