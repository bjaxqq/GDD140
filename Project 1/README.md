# Project 1

## Instructions

Use the drawing primitives that we've gone over in class and others from the p5.js reference, create a simplified self-portrait in p5.js.Try to limit yourself to 10-15 shapes. It can be a cartoon, it can be representational, it can be abstract. Be creative.

## Solution

I created a basic picture of myself. Since it was my first time using p5js, I wanted to keep it simple and made a baisc shape for my head, eyes, and mouth, and just used some triangles for my hair.
