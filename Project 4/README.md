# Project 4

## Instructions

Create a drawing tool. Here is a very basic one. If you want to make continuous line, look at this example and get rid of the background. Try to make something expressive that allows the user to make something that looks unique and distinctive. Use conditional statements to provide at least two (ideally more) different "modes of drawing." For example, you could allow the user to choose between different pen types. One of your modes should use the random() function in some way.

## Solution

This was one of my favorite projects to work on. The user is presented with a blank white canvas and when they drag their mouse or trackpad, a line appears that follows where the cursor is dragged. Using different keys on the keyboard, you have the options to clear the canvas, change the size of the pen, change the pen color (either randomly or type in your own RGB values), and even save the drawing as a PNG image.
