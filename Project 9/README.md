# Project 9

## Instructions

You have two options:

- Find an image you'd like to manipulate (keep your image small â€” biggest side less than 200px). Create three different sketches using that same source image. Make each sketch produce a static image that distorts or manipulates the original in an interesting way. Remember to do the following:
  - Use a small image (biggest side less than 200px).
  - Use the `get()` function we went over in class and nested for loops.
  - Use `noprotect` to stop infinite loop protection.
  - Use the nested for loops within setup not draw.
- Use the `get()` function we went over in class with mouseX and mouseY or your own variables (also, like we went over in class) to creatively reveal an image over time. Like Assignment 9.2 keep your image small (biggest side less than 200px).

## Solution

Going with option 1, I picked 3 specific images of various lakes in Japan and made them black and white. The twist was that I picked the right half of the image to be the original color, and the other half would be black and white. It's random which one you get whenever you run the program.
