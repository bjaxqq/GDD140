### Course Description

This course teaches software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Students develop basic coding expertise and the confidence necessary to create interactive artwork and games. The course teaches essential 21st-century skills including computational and systems thinking, along with quantitative reasoning coupled with creative problem solving and generative visual aesthetics. No previous experience with programming necessary.

### Tools used

In this class, we used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create various digital art projects such as moving landscapes, self-portraits, and platformer games to name a few.
In addition to the base libraries provided through p5.js, we used [p5play](https://p5play.org/) for the last few projects as we worked with sprite and movement physics.

### Project descriptions

Projects were assigned once a week, and we used the new material we learned each week to put those projects together.
