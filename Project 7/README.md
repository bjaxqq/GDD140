# Project 7

## Instructions

For this project, you will be creating a data visualization. You may look at this example I created in p5.js using the dataset that we used for Exercise 7.0. I also used an image (not necessary, but see how to load imagery here). To complete this assignment, please do the following:

- Find a dataset that is interesting to you. It should contain five or more values. I would recommend limiting yourself to less than 50 values to make your life easier.
- Create a sketch in p5.js that is 800px wide by 600px high.
- Create a array in p5.js that will hold your data. Use objects if your data has labels you'd like to use.
- Visualize your data in a thoughtful way (see that thing I did with the "bars").
- Use the `text()` function to title your sketch so your viewer knows what they are looking at and label data as needed.
- Also,  labels values, as appropriate so your viewer can get an idea of scale.

## Solution

Since I really enjoy watching anime, I decided I wanted to display what the top 10 most popular anime series were according to MyAnimeList.com. The canvas has an orange background (inspired by the colors of Crunchyroll, an anime streaming platform) with the 10 bars for each show. One of my favorite features is that inside of each bar there is an image corresponding to the specific show.
