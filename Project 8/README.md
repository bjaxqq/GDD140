# Project 8

## Instructions

For this project, you will have the option:

- Option 1: create a continuously changing, scrolling landscape. This could take the form of scrolling citiscape. It could be a conveyor belt at a factory. It could be a ship moving through outerspace. It could be someone looking out a train window. It could be sailboats on the ocean. If you're lost at how to do this, start with your solution from exercise 8.2 and build off of it. Use classes. You must have at least two different moving object types (i.e. two arrays of objects) in your solution. The landscape should never end. (10 points)
- Option 2: Create your own version of the Coding Train Bubbles class to generate objects. Put your own creative spin on it.

## Solution

I decided to go with the landscape option because I thought it would be fun to try. After a bunch of failed ideas, I settled on a moving landscape of a desert. The clouds in the sky move at different speeds as they would in real life, and the cacti on the ground have some variation as well.
