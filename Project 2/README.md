# Project 2

## Instructions

Use p5.js' time functions and the text functions to creatively visualize time. You can use the following functions: `hour()`,  `minute()` and `second()`. If you are feeling adventuresome try to think of a unique graphic representation of the concept of time... something you haven't seen before. You may wish to experiment with `arc()` and `angleMODE()` in DEGREES or RADIANS. Refer to Make: Chapter 3 pp. 23 - 25.

## Solution

Inspired by the Apple Watch's Activity Rings [(see here)](https://www.apple.com/watch/close-your-rings/), I made a clock that has a digital display in the middle, while the outer three rings represent the seconds, minutes, and hours, going from inside to out.
