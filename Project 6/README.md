# Project 6

## Instructions

Option 1: Create a tiling pattern that changes and evolves with an update at a regular interval of time.
Option 2: Create a sketch that evolves toward disorder.
Option 3: The Game of Life

## Solution

I decided to go with the Game of Life for this one. Having coded this in C++ already [(see here)](https://github.com/bjaxqq/SJP/blob/main/gameOfLife.cpp), I felt confident that I could do it in JavaScript, too. This iteration of Conway's Game of Life has a black background with different shades of purple for the different alive cells.
