# Project 3

## Instructions

Create an interactive sketch in p5.js that uses the `random()` function to alter a drawing each time the user clicks the canvas. Think about drawing something very familiar, where minor variations mean a lot (i.e. faces, bodies or your own interactive Mondrian).

## Solution

Building off of the original portrait project, I decided to upgrade my character. Now when you click the screen, the hair, eyes, skin, shirt, and background all change color. The eyes have four options (green, brown, blue or hazel), the skin has three shades (light, medium, dark), and the rest can be any random RGB value.
