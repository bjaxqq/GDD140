# Project 10

## Instructions

Use what we learned about keyboard input (or using mouse input from earlier in the semester), detecting collisions to create a simple "game" where you control a sprite avoiding obstacles and collecting or picking up other sprites. Do the following:

- Create a player sprite.
- Include at least three other pickup sprites besides the player in your "game." All the pickup sprites should be the same color.
- Include at least three other obstacle sprites that the player sprite must go around. All the obstacle sprites should be the same color.
- Use the keyboard (WASD or Arrow Keys) to control the movement of the player sprite.
- When the player sprite overlaps a pickup sprite the pickup sprite is removed from the game.
- In the beginning of your code, include a few comments about how to play your game.
- Keeping score is optional - for extra credit count the number of pickups and display a score at the top of the canvas. + 2 points.

## Solution

This was a lot of fun to work on. I made a simple game that has the player controlling a white cube. The goal is to pick up coins (yellow squares) and avoid the obstacles (red squares). Each level has the same number of coins as the level number, and for this verison the game goes on infinitely. You have 3 lives, and if you die you can play again.
